For this repository, I created an interactive game based on chance and probability. It is based on the notorious game God of War since it uses its characters and chronology, however the gaming experience is different. The instructions on how to play are in the main menu (it is recommended that if it's the first using the game the user reads it in order to have a better experience). Hope Users enjoy it and have fun playing it. 

DISCLAIMER: There will be no changes/updates to the game, it's fixed.
